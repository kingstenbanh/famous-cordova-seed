##Development
##Install Requirements
###Node.js
First make sure you have `node.js` installed without that nothing works!  You can either install it with your favorite package manager or with [the installer](http://nodejs.org/download) found on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

###Cordova CLI
```
npm install -g cordova
```

##Install Dependencies
From within the root directory:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
cd www
npm install && bower install
```

##Add devices
###Android
```
cordova platforms add android
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.device
cordova run android -d
```

When you are able to run this command successfully, you'll have a working version of a Famo.us app. If you encounter issues connecting to your attached Android device, try using

```
adb devices
```

###iOS
iOS instructions assume the use of Mac OS X
```
cordova platforms add ios
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.device
cordova build ios -d
```

If you encounter ios-sim was not found. Run the following

```
npm install -g ios-sim
```

To emulate the app as iOS app, run the following command line

```
cordova emulate ios
```


##Running the Development Server

Run ```grunt serve``` and you will start a local development server and open Chrome on `port 1337`.  Watch tasks will be running, and your browser will be automatically refreshed whenever a file in the repo changes.

You can run serve with ```--port=9001``` to manually pick the port that the server will run on

Start develop your app in side `www` directory
